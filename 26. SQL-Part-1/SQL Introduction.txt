SQL Introduction:

Introduction to Databases
A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

ðŸ§  Why use databases?
 -> To store large amounts of information efficiently.
 -> To retrieve data quickly.
 -> To keep data consistent and secure.

Real-world examples:
1) Instagram stores user profiles, posts, and messages in databases.
2) Banks store account and transaction details in databases.

ðŸ“‚ Types of Databases
There are different types of databases based on how they store data:

1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)

-> Data is stored in tables (rows and columns).
-> Tables are related to each other using keys.
Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

2. Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases

-> Data is stored in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), key-value pairs, or graphs.
-> Used when data is unstructured or rapidly changing.
Example: MongoDB, Cassandra.

3. In-Memory Databases

-> Stores data in memory (RAM) for very fast access.
Example: Redis.

4. Cloud Databases

-> Managed and accessed through the cloud.
Example: Amazon RDS, Google BigQuery.

RDBMS vs DBMS
Feature	                  DBMS	                             RDBMS
Structure	        Stores data as files	           Stores data in tables
Relationships	  No relationships between data	     Supports relationships with keys
Data Integrity	         Limited	             Enforces integrity with constraints
Example	                 MS Access	                 MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

Data Integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle, 
including during storage, retrieval, and processing. 
It prevents invalid or corrupted data from entering or existing in a database.

Users - UserID, Name, Email, .......................
Marks - UserID, C, Web Development, ML, AI.......................

ðŸŽ¯ Popular RDBMS

1.MySQL

-> Open-source, widely used.
-> Common in web development.

2. PostgreSQL

-> Open-source, powerful features.
-> Great for complex applications.

3. SQLite

-> Lightweight and file-based.
-> Used in mobile apps and small applications.

4. Oracle

-> Paid and highly secure.
-> Used in large enterprises.

5. SQL Server (Microsoft)

-> Paid, integrates well with Windows apps.

ðŸ“Š Basic Database Terminology

1. Database: A container that holds related data (like a folder).

2. Table: Stores data in rows and columns (like an Excel sheet).

3. Row (Record): A single entry in a table.

4. Column (Field): A specific attribute of the data.

Example:
A table called Students:

ID	Name	Age	Grade
1	Rahul	15	A
2	Priya	14	B

Database: "SchoolDB"

Table: "Students"

Columns: ID, Name, Age, Grade

Row: 1, Rahul, 15, A
